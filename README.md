# SuSqNFT-class
I'm using this repo to learn how to create NFTs and develop in Solidity with the SuSquares Community. Shout out to [William Entriken](https://phor.net) , Chen Cheng , and Scarlet Zhou who dedicate their personal time to sharing their knowledge and contributing to the development of technology. I admire them very much. 

// For beginners it is recommended to use [REMIX IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) web compiler for Solidity contracts; however, I decided to install a package on my VS Studio code "Solidity" by Juan Blanco. I will probably use both as I learn.
